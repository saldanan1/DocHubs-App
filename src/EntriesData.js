These include and are not limited to: restrictions, direct contact to the developer and user experiences being ignored. From this, a core group of designers, led by myself were assembled to create a new bot. With closed beta expected September 1st, we are aiming to expand to the greater magic community soon after.\
      While in the development stage, the bot is being worked on by a few developers led by myself. As we reach our initial release, it will become an open sourced project with the hopes of including the community.",

      paragraph1: "People with Cerebral Palsy have trouble controlling/practicing their fine motor skills. Because of this, everyday clothing that contains zippers and buttons are difficult to put on. Changing clothing can be an annoying and anxious time for kids with Cerebral Palsy; we want kids to have a fun way to practice getting dressed.\
      We boiled down the skills involved with zippers and buttons and came up with games that would allow kids to practice these skills. This vest not only allows kids to practice the basic motions behind zippers and buttons, but is also naturally fun and entertaining.",

      paragraph2: "The skills involved in zippering and buttoning are pulling, pinching, holding (two hands), and slipping through a small opening. The games associated with each skill vary from spinners to levers to fill-in-hole matching toys. Every toy on the vest has a specific purpose.\
      Many pieces of clothing made for someone with CP are adaptive and simplify the process of getting dressed and undressed, but the Skills Vest teaches the kids to possibly be able to use the zippers and buttons on everyday clothing. This eliminates the purchase of an entire adaptive wardrobe.",
